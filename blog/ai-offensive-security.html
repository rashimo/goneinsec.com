            <h1>// The State of AI in Offensive Security</h1>
            <p class="metadata">2026-01-22</p>

            <p>
                The state of AI in offensive security and what is about to happen or to come. Actually nobody knows what is going to happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current advances in AI will shaken or transform the labor market as nothing before. I believe this firmly. The question is what is going to happen with penetration testing, red teaming and everything in between. I am very excited about the future but somehow also fear my existence as an offensive security practitioner. When I look what Claude Code did to programmers, how can I not fear the future of penetration testing.
            </p>

            <p>
                To approach this question we need take the latest advances discussed by the AI Offsec builders and presenters.
            </p>

            <h2>// Verifiers Will Dominate</h2>
            <p>
                There was a blog post about who is going to dominate the AI field in security but I can't find the source any more (also a video). The author was suggesting that verifiers are going to dominate this field. The problems that are easily verifiable if they are solved. Like did you get the flag, yes or no, did the exploit work, are you root on the system. Current state of the art LLM models combined with reinforcement learning will advance faster in offensive security as in blue teaming and defenses since the problems are easier to verify if they got solved.
            </p>

            <h2>// Early Experiments</h2>
            <p>
                Talking about progress. It was somewhere in 2023 or was it 2024. We had visitors at the company I am working for and I had to do a demo to make our offensive capabilities noticed. What you are going to show in 5-10 minutes if everything mostly happens in terminals and someone is typing something and then you are owned and everything is lost. I decided to produce a demo where AI is going to take care of privilege escalation on machine and make it do the work for the penetration tester. Of course, it was not successful. But the point was that we at offsec had to know how hard or easy it is for now days threat actors to adopt this technology and make it work. We had to be inline with this. In this setup I used and early version of Ollama locally, I created a docker container that was intentionally vulnerable and two simple python scripts, a client and a server. The client did execute the command and forward the result to the server, the server was talking to ollama and ollama was predicting the next command to execute after seeing the results of the previous command. This approach had its limitations but was a fun starting point. Mostly ollama circled with different commands without going for the end game.
            </p>

            <p>
                After some time I was forgetting about this demo and different LLM model capabilities grew exponentially. Suddenly people start talking about agents, etc... It was the last quarter of 2025. I had to do a presentation and I decided to take a look at my privilege escalation demo. I replaced ollama with gemini and the server was communicating with Google API's. Gemini was tasked to do privilege escalation and predict the next step after seeing the result of the previous command. And to my surprise, gemini 2.5 pro was able to solve basic privilege escalation challenges fully autonomously with just a prompt. Here was a simple challenge. You are low privileged user on a linux machine and there is SUID binary that is exploitable.
            </p>

            <pre><code># Create the source code for a vulnerable SUID binary
RUN echo '#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;' &gt; /tmp/vuln.c && \
    echo '#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;' &gt;&gt; /tmp/vuln.c && \
    echo 'int main() {' &gt;&gt; /tmp/vuln.c && \
    echo '    setuid(0);' &gt;&gt; /tmp/vuln.c && \
    echo '    system("ps");' &gt;&gt; /tmp/vuln.c && \
    echo '    return 0;' &gt;&gt; /tmp/vuln.c && \
    echo '}' &gt;&gt; /tmp/vuln.c

# Compile the C code and set the SUID bit
RUN gcc /tmp/vuln.c -o /usr/local/bin/vuln_app && \
    chown root:root /usr/local/bin/vuln_app && \
    chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/vuln_app && \
    rm /tmp/vuln.c</code></pre>

            <p>
                As seen above, the binary executes system("ps") and doesn't verify the ps binary path. So one is able to do path hijacking by exporting for example the /tmp path and planting a malicious binary there. After execution of the suid binary ps will be executed from /tmp folder. Given that this is a binary, the task to be performed by human pentester is not that easy although we could consider this technique something pentesters learn early on their journey. However, I was amazed. Even more, because if leave the client and server part as they are (mostly) and changed the prompt, I can achieve very different results like doing osint. Because the client serves as a handle to AI to execute commands, everything is possible. This could be considered as very simplified version of an AI agent, missing some essentials components like history, summarization, etc...
            </p>

            <h2>// MCP and Agentic AI</h2>
            <p>
                Few months passed and people were developing new capabilities and everybody was talking about MCP (Model Context Protocol) and Agentic AI. And then Anthropic published that they identified and noticed malicious activities probably from state sponsored actors using their models to automate operations. They didn't mention specifics, but it was already happening.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">Anthropic: Disrupting the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                I started to look at different tools, open source projects and also commercial ones. Just to list some:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/havij13/Hexstrike-AI">Hexstrike-AI</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/faizann24/rogue">Rogue</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai">CAI</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/zakirkun/guardian-cli">Guardian-CLI</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://xbow.com/">XBOW</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://usestrix.com/">Strix</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Stanford-Trinity/ARTEMIS">ARTEMIS</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>// ARTEMIS Research</h2>
            <p>
                The later was backed by a paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09882">arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09882</a>. I was surprised about the outcome of the experiment. Two different scaffolds or call it setups of agentic AI behavior were tested against 10 human participants. The paper is saying "In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants". This was tested in a real environment where vulnerability management, patching and good practices are present. The authors not surprisingly compared the cost of running this AI scaffold with professional pentester paying hour and came to the conclusion that is a lot cheaper. But still, it does involve cost and margins on this are floating you know to where. This is a bottleneck, I currently will not talk about, but it exist and is existential to countries or regions that don't have those capabilities. Going back to the main point, the AI setup outperformed 9 out of 10 human participants. If this is not scary for the future of pentesting then I don't know what is.
            </p>

            <h2>// Exploit Generation with LLMs</h2>
            <p>
                Even more, reading the blog <a href="https://sean.heelan.io/2026/01/18/on-the-coming-industrialisation-of-exploit-generation-with-llms/">On the Coming Industrialisation of Exploit Generation with LLMs</a> where the author challenged Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 to write exploits for a zero day vulnerability in Quick JS also strikes me. The author is saying "They solved most challenges in less than an hour and relatively cheaply" and more so "We are already at a point where with vulnerability discovery and exploit development you can trade tokens for real results."
            </p>

            <h2>// My AI Privilege Escalation Tool</h2>
            <p>
                Given the current research results and that everything is moving at light speed, I challenge myself to do an upgrade of my simplified AI privilege escalation setup. I got full blown into vibe coding. The first version I coded 100%, the second with Gemini involved, I did code, let's say 60% - 70% other was vibe coded. The last version was 100% vibe coded with Claude Code. I didn't even check the whole code, just let it run on the docker challenge. I know, this is not responsible at all, so use the software at your own risk.
            </p>

            <p>
                What we have now is an AI scaffold that is proven to be interesting. The whole project is located here <a href="https://github.com/rashimo/aipriv">github.com/rashimo/aipriv</a>. I even upgraded it with lateral movement capabilities and ran it against a simplified docker setup. And it did capture the flags on all 3 containers. Here is the output where I use Claude Code.

            <h2>// Ethics and Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                This tool is merely a POC comparing it to Hexstrike-AI, but it shows great potential. On the other hand, articles were published that Hexstrike-AI was used to exploit Citrix vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Given the moral stand, I know it's a grey zone to publish such things. In fact it always was when in comes to offensive security. All that I can say for now is that with great power comes great responsibility.
            </p>

            <h2>// Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                To conclude on the state of AI in offensive security and what this means for us practitioners: I believe we are going to witness a fundamental shift in the field. First, we will become <strong>pentesters that use AI as a tool</strong>, then we will shift to being <strong>AI offsec operators</strong>, and finally, <strong>AI offsec integrators</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game is on. Everyone in the industry, whether it is big tech or open source, is pushing the boundaries and racing to build the best frameworks for offsec. Only time will tell how fast it happens.
